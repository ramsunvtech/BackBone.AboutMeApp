Hopefully this tutorial will allow you to build a much more robust project with great separation of concerns between design and code.</p><p>This tutorial will get you started on combining Backbone.js with AMD (Asynchronous Module Definitions) through Require.js. In addition to Require.js, Text.js plays a significant role by loading the html templates and preparing them for the underscore templating process.</p>"
